### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luis Cristo. I'm a Full Stack developer working with the MERN Stack, Gatsby, and Python. I'm currently working on an app to figure out the meaning of life. I'll let you know when that ships out ðŸ˜„. 

Always looking to improve my skill so advice, criticism, help and tips are appreciated. I'm looking foward to connecting with other developers.
